# Algorithm Patterns in Python

A curated collection of **classic algorithm problems solved by pattern** in Python.

This repository helps developers:
- recognize common algorithmic patterns
- map problems to the right technique
- improve problem-solving speed
- build intuition instead of memorizing solutions

## What Are Algorithm Patterns?
Most coding problems are variations of a small set of underlying strategies.  
Strong programmers don’t memorize solutions — they **recognize patterns**.

This repo organizes problems by those patterns.

## Covered Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Two Pointers | Efficient traversal using two indices |
| Sliding Window | Optimized subarray / substring problems |
| Binary Search | Search in sorted or monotonic spaces |
| DFS / BFS | Graph and tree traversal |
| Backtracking | Exploring all possibilities |
| Dynamic Programming | Breaking problems into subproblems |
| Greedy | Locally optimal choices |
| Prefix Sum | Fast range queries |
| Heap / Priority Queue | Efficient min/max retrieval |
| Union Find | Disjoint set operations |
